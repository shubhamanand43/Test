1.
Design and develop a program in a language of your choice to solve the
triangle problem defined as follows: Accept three integers which are
supposed to be the three sides of a triangle and determine if the three
values represent an equilateral triangle, isosceles triangle, scalene triangle,
or they do not form a triangle at all. Assume that the upper limit for the size
of any side is 10. Derive test cases for your program based on boundary value
analysis, execute the test cases and discuss the results.
